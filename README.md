# Flops-Comparison

Archived writing two MATLAB functions that both take as input: n × n matrix A, n × n matrix B, n × 1 matrix x. Have the first function compute ABx through (AB)x and the second through A(Bx), and both functions output the number of flops used. Compared which function uses fewer flops when applying both algorithms on random matrices/vectors of size n = 100, 200, 400, 800
